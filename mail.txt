Subject: Defective item #7250
Dear Sir or Madam:
We ordered item#7250 and received it today. Although there were no problems at first, the machine began to emit strange noises and bad smells after only two hours of operation. We opened the motor box and found several electrical wires were scorched. We believe the item we received is defective. This defect is causing great damage to our productivity.
Your customer service phone line has been busy for about one hour. Please contact us as soon as possible.
Sincerely yours,
Quentin Barr
